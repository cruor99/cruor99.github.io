Target - Just keep the progress going with the MVC App

It's been WAY too long since I posted... We're back on it.

The past couple of weeks have mostly been around getting the scaffolding for the MVC app in place, it's boring as hell and not really worth talking about. The stream has however come on leaps and bounds. The crew is really rock solid, everyone's finding a place and keeping the chat pretty lively.

So I feel like I've lost momentum with the blog too, which really sucks, I will do better, I'm going to dedicate the last 15 minutes of my stream to getting either a short blog post written about something notable from that stream, or put that time into a bigger more eductational or fun blog post. I think that makes sense...

Either way I'm pretty tired out right now, it's been a crazy few weeks with work but we've just gotten over a huge hurdle and it's all coming together at last so maybe another week and I'll be back on it with the blog.

I'm totally going to write a blog post on the little end credits HTML thing I've put on the stream, but that's definitely not for tonight.

Big thanks to everyone that keeps coming back for more. I think we're damn close to getting this going here.

Lots of Love

Mike
