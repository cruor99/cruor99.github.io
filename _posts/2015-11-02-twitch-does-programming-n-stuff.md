Watch the recording on twitch.tv [here](http://www.twitch.tv/mikedoescode/v/23666347)  

Stream Type - MikeDoesCode   
Music - Chillstep / Dubstep / 'ting   
Mood - Open and Optimistic   
Target - Test the water of the twitch community and get some unit tests working.

So tonight heralded my first time trying to run the MikeDoesCode development stream on the twitch platform, and despite a few concerns about possible spammers a quick setup of moobot and the fast action by devexer have meant this was by far the smoothest stream to date.

I don't have a lot to say about the code from tonight as it was highly un-interesting, but getting to dabble with the new Bosto 22U mini display I've got for pen drawing was certainly fun. Also I started setting up a restreaming server to allow some of the regulars and conversationalists a lower latency video link so they get my responses faster. Part of what I preferred about livecoding was the low latency video allowing for faster interaction with the viewers but I don't think it's vital.

It looks like I'll be allowed to stream out some of the non-code related things I do to take my head away from the excess logic on here too, so I'll be doing some design work with my new pen display and I'll probably do some DJ set preparation work in the future too!

Either way now we start the stats again...

Stream Stats:  
 - Followers: 38 (+38 wooo)   
 - View Count:  No Idea    
 - Peak Viewers: I saw 37 at one point...   

Much love to everyone who keeps tuned in, see you all again soon!
