So here it is... My first professional blog.

I've recently started on the first personal project that I really want to track, I'm streaming most of the work I do on the app out to livecoding.tv, and I want a place to keep my notes and thoughts from those streams. The streams are open to the public for educational purposes, so why shouldn't the notes be too?

I'm still learning markdown, so I hope my blogs will slowly improve over time as I get to grips with how to express myself in this language.

I'll start the ball rolling with another post that re-caps the first week of project work once I've tested this all out.
