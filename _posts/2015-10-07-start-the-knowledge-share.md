aaaaand an impromptu semi-interview from fellow livecoding.tv streamer [AlexBooker](https://www.livecoding.tv/alexbooker/), it was a pleasure having Alex in the teamspeak channel, keeping things moving while we waited for missing dependencies and build reports from Eamonn!

Watch the recording on livecoding.tv [here](https://www.livecoding.tv/video/mikedoescode-knowledge-share/)  

Stream Type - MikeDoesCode / Some new as yet unnamed interview format... Mike & Friends?  
Music - House, DnB, 'n' Ting   
Mood - Level  
Target - Get Eamonndh up to speed with building and running the unit tests  

I had a great time on tonights stream, good touches on the developmental banter streams and what they are really about, while also having a coding focus, but more about the kind of stuff that you'll inevitably have to go through in one direction or another during a career as a software dev. Many people will start out as a solo jockey, just bashing around getting things done, but if you happen to do it right first time, you'll be successful and your team will grow beautifully and you're going to have to start knowledge sharing hard! 

Now even if you do everything wrong, ideally the business will still do well enough for you to expand and you're going to have to get someone else poking around your code base sooner or later. Sometimes they will be significantly more experienced than you are, sometimes they will be total novices, sometimes though, you get a *coder*. When you come across a coder they don't really have a "skill level" they just love writing code and will happily sit and learn any new language you put in front of them, and then go about trying to make it do something interesting, their job is just made a hell of a lot easier by the simple notion of having a goal and a target put in front of them. A coder gets faster at this process the more they do it, the first language/framework can take a while to grasp at an appropriate level, then a few more frameworks come along to play with that do similar things and playing with those gets a coder up to speed pretty quickly. New languages come along and they get some spikes and work done in them and the more this goes on, the easier it becomes to pick up a new language or framework. This skill is absolutely vital, sure there's a place for a maintenance developer, who knows the ins-and-outs of a particular language and just wants to curate and look after an old as hell system, but those systems are going to get re-worked and replaced at some point, it's an absolute certainty that a systems purpose will either become obsolete or will be replaced with something "better" in hopefully a few ways, sometimes the replacement is worse, but that's a whole other topic!

Back to the stream, getting Eamonndh up to speed in the project is a good thing for the project because it forces me to knowledge share a bit more about the structure, it'll help me develop the required documentation and diagrams as part of the process of describing the different functions of the application, and hopefully it'll be a good experience for Eamonn to get his hands dirty in a business oriented code base.

We covered a little bit about Orleans and the implications of "Virtual" actors, and how the process of our door bell system is modelled in an actor oriented manner, we'll be going a bit deeper into those concepts as the weeks progress and I look at expanding my streaming setup with some new toys.
