*Update* moments after tweeting about this... my account has re-appeared! Like magic... no such luck for  my compatriot devexer though.

So this post isn't following on in the usual format, this post is coming from the heart! I've never had a reasonable or decent response to any of either my messages or emails to livecoding support or drmjg... so here's a public letter.

TLDR: Livecoding.tv strikes again, and deleted my account for streaming to both twitch and livecoding.tv. I'd really like to see the first 5 weeks of progress on my project, someone else might too?

Live on stream tonight my account was deleted from Livecoding.tv with no warning, and with it goes 5 weeks of content documenting the early days creating my new product. Go and look -> [www.livecoding.tv/mikehardman](http://www.livecoding.tv/mikehardman) and go and check back on all my blog post links to videos... 

To give a little bit of backstory here, I found out about livecoding.tv thanks to HackerNews, I've been a software developer for nearly half my life, and when you spend such a large part of your life in those circles, you'll catch onto some of the culture. Well hacker news is a big part of that culture for me, it's one of my daily newspapers, it keeps me in a few good loops. Livecoding.tv looked perfect when I read about it on hn. I've been in industry for 15 years, I've spent every moment of that career learning and refining my craft and I finally had a project that looked like it might be interesting to do in a more public way. Maybe this was the start of me being able to give something back to the software development world, to give some advice and teachings that I've learned on my career path so far, and maybe make something cool of my own at the same time.

After my third week of streaming I was invited to take part in what they called their "streamer program", my stream had been growing at a strong rate, and more than one individual called it the "best stream on livecoding". It's certainly not how I would start advertising my little attempt at creation, but it seemed my channel was striking a chord with the community in general and every time I streamed I would get pleasant and warm visits from the other streamers as well as a dedicated and growing following. The encouragement and camaraderie of people in this community is amazing, I was hooked. I was browsing other channels in my time off stream giving people encouragement, advice and just generally participating.

During my time on the site I had a few interactions with their staff, while my stream was starting to take off I really wanted to stream out some of the activities that help me take my head away from the coding problems I while my days away trying to solve. I like to DJ when I get the chance and I like to play a few games, I asked very politely if livecoding.tv would add a non-code section that maybe wasn't archived or didn't count to views. I wanted to stay engaged with my audience without it always having to be about code. I was told that livecoding.tv was too small for this kind of thing and it could be looked at in the future. This is when I signed up to twitch... 

Then the Liza fiasco happened, I was concerned. I'd had a few interactions with drmjg on the site, but they couldn't be called conversations. I'm a little upset with myself for not taking screenshots of all my interactions on there, but I didn't do anything with the intention of having to write this blog post.

I'm writing this mostly because I don't think the Liza situation was handled properly, and the same behaviour is driving the deletion of my account and all of the content (some items with thousands of views) and along with it the follows of well over 200 users and counting.

Why is one man controlling this community with an iron fist? Why has my channel just been deleted when I was still streaming my usual brand of quality content out to both livecoding.tv and twitch? I never streamed non-code to livecoding, and I *ALWAYS* streamed my code content to livecoding... Why is a well known member of the community getting removed without warning?

Not only that... but why was devexers account also removed from the site at the same time? Devexer was only ever a committed follower of my stream, who discovered it via the livecoding.tv website. 

We need an answer from either drmjg or the lctv board about why he lied to Liza, about his behaviour on twitter, hackernews, and the lctv website under the guise of drmjg and livecoding_support, about the incessant and excess spam... I had livecoding_support jump into my channel mid stream to "remind me" in a big block of text to utilise the "Schedule" to advertise the time of my stream to get more followers... guess what? the stream that was currently in-progress was on the schedule. *facepalm*

I said this to Dr Mjg in a private email, but I shall ask it again in public this time: "Why should I stream my content and continue to build my audience on your platform? You've not been able to answer this question, that I only felt I should ask once your errant and unusual behaviour on hacker news and the site itself led me to lose faith in your ability to run such a community."

Obviously I feel somewhat justified in asking this question again in public given the presently self destructive behaviour of deleting my account instead of attempting to retain me.

The live-coding community phenomenon feels very real to me, I believe in it. Livecoding.tv isn't the first attempt at this (hello, watchpeoplecode? and now twitch programming!) and I think that although livecoding.tv have done a lot of things very right, they've completely missed their mark with both their community management and their PR.

I didn't want to leave, I didn't want my community to have to move, but my hand has been more than forced. Why would anyone entrust their content, their time and their effort to a site that has consistently failed to respond to questions, and consistently screwed up its public image?

Hopefully this will only serve to strengthen the collective of live coding streamers that I very proudly call myself a part of!

(For those interested, I started properly archiving my streams once it became clear I wouldn't be able to download or edit the past broadcasts on livecoding, I have a nice cloud server [running nginx and the rtmp module](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/how-to-set-up-your-own-private-rtmp-server-using-nginx.50/) that archives and re-streams my content out, it was sending it out to livecoding and twitch, I guess I can remove the livecoding stream path now eh?)
