Music - Progressive Breakbeat   
Mood - Sunday Special (slightly hungover)  
Target - Play with Azure Mobile Services, build the example ToDo app and add authentication.  

Today's stream was a very relaxed affair, I wanted to try out authentication and push notifications utilising the Azure Mobile Services platform. After setting up the mobile service in the azure portal we are provided with a downloadable example project with all of the boilerplate done for both Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows Store applications that run on Windows 8.1 and 10.

It was surprisingly easy to get running, deploying the API to Azure was seamless thanks to the Visual Studio integration and barring a slight hiccup with my phone already having too many developer mode applications on it, running the apps on phone and desktop was also extremely smooth.

A quick two hours of stream time with plenty of chat and I had a working ToDo list application that's utilising facebook authentication and storing its data in an Azure database.

All in all I'm very happy with todays antics :)
