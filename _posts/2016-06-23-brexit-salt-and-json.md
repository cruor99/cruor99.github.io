Today is the 25th of june, two days after the British people bravely voted to leave
the European union. I will not inject any of my personal feelings or leanings as to the
referendum in this post, but I will note that I was extremely pleased with the result.

The reson I write this blogpost, is because I noticed something came up on Twitter, after
a certain [petition became popular](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215)

![Petition for second referendum](http://puu.sh/pFQMK/3b908f1632.png)


I will not comment on the petition itself, but what surrounds it has shown an interesting example of how people interpret data when trying to dig for explanations.
The UK government is phenomenal in its use of Open Data, and as such - every single petition has a very detailed [json data scheme](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215)

In this, we can find the following result: {"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB","signature_count":361698}
