So first of all, thank you for checking out my blog. This is intended to be the dumping ground for all my thoughts and a log of the activites I'll be performing during the creation and hopeful operation of my pet project. A project that will almost certainly require every bit of knowledge and every ounce of skill I have aquired and honed over an already fruitful career in technology.

First a bit about me...

## Personal Details

  I grew up with the most curious nature out of anyone I've ever met, and from what I can work out, anyone any of my teachers ever came across too.
  
  This curiosity has served me well in the technology industry. I've worked in various technical positions across many sectors over the past 15 or so years. I've built small and large products as part of solo or massively distributed teams, and I have enjoyed performing my technical duties immensely.   

  I've recently taken on an ambitious project with the aim of changing the way we think about our doorbells and personal notification in general, and I will use this blog to document the process of development, along with (hopefully mostly tech related) anecdotes.  
  
  In my down-time I enjoy night life, DJing and socialising as much as I enjoy playing video games, reading and cooking. I tend to seek out means of creating or entertaining as I despise being idle.
  
  I listen to a lot of varied music when I code, from nice ambient, classical and chillstep to heavy metal, techno and drum & bass. Almost anything can go, but the music is very much driven by my current mood and the type of work I'm doing.

## About the Project

  My pet project is called Presence, and its goal is to bring the power of the cloud to the humble doorbell.
  
  I want the ability to control who can ring my doorbell, and when. I want to be able to say "hey, my friends and family can interrupt me right now, but anyone else can leave me a message", just like I can with my phone calls or instant messages.
  
  I want to be notified in a way that fits my current status, if I'm listening to loud music on my headphones I want a visual, or haptic notification, maybe I want to be notified on my wearable device or maybe I just want to ensure someone else will be notified when my doorbell is rung... my imaginary butler perhaps?
  
  These two simple desires form the basis of "Presence", take some ringers, some bells, throw in some rules about what can do what and we might just have a solution.
