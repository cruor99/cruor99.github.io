1. Is this nudejs? - No fro5t... it's not.  

2. What is it? - It's a doorbell, seriously... a doorbell.  

3. Why all the code for just a doorbell? - Well it's a cloud based, rule engine for a doorbell type notification system... so I can make it so only my facbeook friends can ring my doorbell, or I get an email about my doorbell when I am out of my house... or well... why not?  

4. What's Orleans? - Orleans is an actor based framework that Microsoft recently open sourced.  

5. How do I learn this? - To quote Shia "JUST DO IT!" get an IDE down, pick a basic starter project "a todo list, an address book, a dvd inventory system... ANYTHING", make it easy and basic, then make it start saving things to disk, then to a databse, then to the cloud, then make it shiny, make it flash different colours... make it *do* things... That is how you learn code. 

6. F#?? - I'm a huge fan of F# and functional programming in general, had the Orleans framework been compatible with F# and the TPL the way it is implemented here then this middle tier would have been an F# 

7.
